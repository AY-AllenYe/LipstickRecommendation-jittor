# Lipstick-Recommendation
**AY-AllenYe @ HDU**

Wish this project helps you. And your Star is really helpful.

This projects is aiming to provide several similar lipsticks (mainly in colors) with the user updates.

## version 1.x

### Explanation

**1.Dataset**

​	I searched from Github and got 288 items of a JSON file [lipstick.json](./datasets/lipstick.json) which includes attributes of 288 different lipsticks. The JSON file shows the attributes of every items such as brands, series, names, ids, and the most important one, the HEX colors. 

​	I programmed some python files to processed the HEX color, convert the HEX color to RGB, HSV, then I create a CSV file to store information the JSON file shows and the attributes I processed. Also, I made 288 JPG solid color images by the HEX value.

​	I split the dataset: 95% for training (272 items) and 5% for validation (15 items), not shuffled.

**2.Cluster**

​	I choose to use K-Means to made the cluster. 

​	To determined the number of cluster (the K in K-Means), I programmed in a 'for' loop and judge by calculating the WCSS and silhouettes score to determined the K.

​	In the program, I also visualized the curves of WCSS and silhouettes score by the increasing K, and automatically choose the best K. After the determination, the program visualized the distribution and the cluster. Moreover, the program itself created a new CSV file to save the cluster name and ID, and another new CSV file to store the dictionary of the cluster ID and related cluster name.

​	My machine suggested me set K to 5, and I did.

**3.Train**

​	I choose ResNet50 in Jittor framework (it should be okay to use Tensorflow or Pytorch, I haven't try).

​	I set batch_size to 68 (68 equals to 272 divided by 4), num_classes to 5 (the suggestion given by K-Means) and 80 epochs.

**4.Results**

​	About 1 hour to train (80 epochs). The package occupies about 9MB of space.

​	The best model (saved by the Epoch 80) scores 98.53% in Trainset, and scores 14/15 in validation set.

**5.Inference**

​	Batch or single sample is supported. 

​	To classify batch samples, users need a folder to store the JPG solid color images (PNG images is okay, but have to change one piece of code.)

​	To classify single sample, users need to type HEX color in the command.

### Bash
GUI Test
```
cd

python gui.py
```

Algorithm Test
```
cd
python dataset_proceed.py
python train.py

python infer.py
```

​	The users are probably change the path.

### Dependency

​	In my machine these wheels is tested related. Among them, jittor needs paired numpy (the newest update of jittor may report error). Thus it's strongly suggested install the same version of jittor and numpy. Others can install as default.

```
jittor == 1.3.8.5
numpy == 1.26.4
PIL == 12.0.0
pandas == 2.3.3 
tqdm == 4.67.1
sklearn == 1.7.2
dlib == 20.0.0
and others.
```

### Updated Logs

**Info**

    The application is partly done. The author will not update as frequently as this month, but will not abandon this project in the future.


**TODO**
    
    Basic functions:
        1.Function: Recognize image user updated, and fetch the color automatically. However I haven't decided to rule the updated images(Lipsticks? Portrait? or others?)
        2.Function: Better method of recommendation and list recommended items' information of its online shopping website.
        3.Function: Virtual dress-on on the real-time video capture of human face.
